# flybrain — the digital fly (Phase 1)

A connectome-constrained rate model of the male fruit fly brain, built from MaleCNS v1.0.

| file | what it does |
|---|---|
| `graph.py` | builds `data/graph_brain.npz` (CSR, W[post, pre] = synapse count × sign of pre) and `graph_brain_meta.feather` |
| `model.py` | `FlyBrain`: r ← r + k·(f(αWr + I + b) − r); tanh / threshold / mixed units; input normalisation |
| `checks.py` | the two biology checks and gain calibration → `data/checks.json` |
| `export_activity.py` | tick-by-tick activity of both experiments → `data/activity.json` (injected into the atlas by `build_viewer.py`) |

Run order (from the project root, with `.venv` active):

```bash
python -m flybrain.graph
python -m flybrain.checks
python -m flybrain.export_activity
python build_viewer.py
```

## The neuron set

144,209 traced neurons on the brain side of the neck: optic lobes (89,390 intrinsic + 4,114
photoreceptors), central brain (32,160 intrinsic, 4,868 sensory, 107 motor, 72 endocrine),
9,201 visual projection + 563 centrifugal, 1,314 descending, 1,846 ascending, 537 sensory
ascending, and a few dozen efferents. 21.27 M signed edges carrying 99.4 M synapses.

Signs (one per neuron, from the dataset's neurotransmitter predictions): acetylcholine +
(92,375), glutamate − (26,874), GABA − (16,733), histamine − (5,902; photoreceptors). Dopamine
(392), serotonin (305) and octopamine (77) neurons are modulatory and silent in version one.
1,551 neurons with no confident prediction are assumed cholinergic.

## The working model

Graded tanh units, every neuron's inputs normalised to sum to 1 in magnitude, global gain 1.5,
dt/τ = 0.25 (5 ms ticks, 20 ms time constant). Activity is relative to rest. Input
normalisation bounds the spectral radius by the gain (Gershgorin), which is what keeps the
network from saturating: the raw signed matrix has a leading eigenvalue of 4,089 (4,767 for the
excitatory subgraph), dominated by the optic lobe's columnar loops, so any single global scale
that keeps it stable starves the central brain's 50-synapse pathways.

Known limitation: normalisation under-weights strong inputs onto neurons with very many
synapses. Example along the sugar path: the second-order sugar neurons receive 20–70% of their
input from sugar taste neurons, but the premotor neuron Roundup receives only 1.2–1.7% of its
input from them (84–95 of ~6,000 synapses), and MN9 6% from Roundup. The motor response is
therefore real but small (about 1% of the peak response). Phase 3 learns per-edge gains, which
is the principled fix; a leaky integrate-and-fire variant (Shiu et al. 2024) is the other.

## Check results (gain 1.5)

- **A, sugar → feeding.** 187 labellar sugar taste neurons driven (chosen as those with ≥ 2
  synapses onto the Shiu 2022 sugar interneurons G2N-1, Phantom, Usnea, Rattle, Zorro). Those
  interneurons respond at 60% of the network's peak. MN9 is pushed above rest (+0.011 of peak,
  rank 2,923 of 144,209 = top 2%). Twenty random sensory sets of the same size (other labellar
  taste neurons, brain mechanosensory neurons) give MN9 −0.0024 ± 0.0028, max +0.0036: z = 4.8.
  0.7% of neurons respond. PASS.
- **B, light on the right eye.** 891 right R1–R6 photoreceptors driven. Lamina L1/L2: right
  0.216 vs left 0.0002. T4/T5 motion detectors: right 0.053 vs left 0.0001. Lobula plate
  tangential cells: right 0.007 vs left 0.000. 7.5% of neurons respond. PASS.

## Speed (Apple M4, CPU, 21 M edges)

batch 1 × 32 ticks: 2.7 s (84 ms/tick). batch 128 × 32 ticks: 22 s (0.7 s/tick). PyTorch's
sparse CSR tensors are not implemented on Apple's MPS backend, so training (Phase 3) needs a
CUDA GPU as the plan assumed.
